/**
 * Series 1 XBee -- receive IO samples from remote radio
 * In this example we are going to set pin 20 to analog input, pins 11 and 12 to digital input, and configure change detect for pin 12.
 * Change detect sends a sample whenever the remote XBee detects a change from or to ground; 
 * it does not detect the transition from open circuit to high or vice versa.
 *  
 * Configuration:
 * 
 * This assumes we are starting with the factory default settings and the XBee is in API mode (AP = 2)
 * 
 * Remote radio:
 * 
 * MY = 1 necessary?
 * sets pin 20 to analog input
 * D0 = 2
 * sets pin 11 to digital input
 * D4 = 3 
 * sets pin 12 to digital input for change detect
 * D7 = 3 
 * turn on change detect for D7.  we need a bit mask of 10000000 (if you can't convert base 2 to hex in your head either, it's 0x80)
 * why 10000000?  we place a 1 in the position of each input we want to enable, so if you want to enable for D4 and D7 it would be 10010000
 * IC = 80
 * we want 1 sample per packet
 * IT = 1
 * receive samples every 5 seconds
 * IR = 1388
 * (coordinator address) necessary? doesn't it always send to coordinator?
 * DL = 0
 * (save configuration) 
 * WR 
 * 
 * Coordinator:
 * 
 * (set as coordinator)
 * CE = 1 
 * (set address)
 * MY = 0 
 * (end device) necessary?
 * DL = 1
